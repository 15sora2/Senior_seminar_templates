Senior_seminar_templates
========================

LaTeX templates for UMM CSci senior seminar.

There are three main components here:
* sig-alternate.cls which is our modified version of the ACM sig-alternate document class.
* annotated_bibliography.tex and annotated_bibliography.bib, which provide an example of using LaTeX and BibTex to generate an annotated bibliography.
* sample_paper.tex, sample_paper.bib, and sample_graph.pdf, which provide an example of writing a paper using this document class.

The primary changes we've made to the ACM document class and examples are:
* Replaced the copyright notice with a Creative Commons license.
* Removed the ACM document fees.
* Simplified the examples somewhat, removing features such as multiple authors that we're not likely to use.
